# CLICC-DTSC Integration Project

The purpose of this project is to prototype one possible form of remote
user interaction with the CLiCC database in order to obtain information in
a semi-automated way.

The project implements a web service in
[django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/) that exposes a basic
schema of chemical properties and LCIA results.
